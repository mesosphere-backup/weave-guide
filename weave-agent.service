Description=Weave Net, Weave proxy & Weave Docker Plugin for DC/OS Agent nodes
Documentation=http://weave.works/docs
# DC/OSâ€™s mesos-dns (on DC/OS masters) is used to connect to initial weave peers, 
# so wait for dcos-spartan, which is used for DC/OS agent node DNS to startup first
# This is one of the last DC/OS services to startup.
After=docker.service dcos.target dcos-spartan.service
Wants=docker.service dcos-spartan.service

[Service]
Restart=always
StartLimitInterval=0
RestartSec=15

EnvironmentFile=-/etc/weave.env
# Start weave router without weave-dns since DC/OS uses mesos-dns
# Do not restart weave when docker restarts, let systemd control weave
# Use DC/OS master zookeeper DNS FQDNs (answered by mesos.dns, 
# which is authoritative for .mesos, .zk, and .thisdcos.directory). These nodes will always exist,
# and will resolve, even if DC/OS cluster is single master, 3 masters, or 5 masters. 
# Thus weave will have a reliable set of seed nodes (all DC/OS masters) via DNS, 
# and since weave is a mesh architecture it needs at least one bootstrap/seed node.  

ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/weave launch-router --no-dns --no-restart --ipalloc-init=observer zk-1.zk zk-2.zk zk-3.zk zk-4.zk zk-5.zk

# todo: remove weave proxy unit installed by default and use this one instead
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/weave launch-proxy --no-restart 

#Start the weave docker plugin, so docker can also use weave
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/weave launch-plugin --no-restart
